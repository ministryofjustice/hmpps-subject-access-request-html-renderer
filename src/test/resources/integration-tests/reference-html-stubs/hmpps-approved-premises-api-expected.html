        Mr Davies was released from custody on 11/12/20 street homeless, all necessary referrals were completed for additional housing support however on 12/12/20 a call was made to the police from his ex partners mother claiming that he was with Ms Smith at her property, the police attended and found that he was in the property he was subsequently arrested and charged with Breach of Restraining Order, he appeared in court and received a financial penalty. Despite this given the concerns in terms of this breach a decision was made to recall Mr Davies to custody.

        Mr Davies reported that he has been in an &#x27;on/off relationship with Sarah Smith for a number of years. They had a daughter in 2018, xxx, who was adopted out of the family 2019. Records indicate that the cause of concern for safeguarding was Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour and Ms Smiths continued relationship with him against the recommendation of the child protection plan.
        
        There are ongoing concerns regarding domestic abuse within Mr Davies and Ms Smiths relationship. He was further convicted for an assault upon Ms Smith in November 2020 and a Restraining Order was put in place to further safeguard her from Mr Davies preventing any contact. He is aware this expires in November 2023. He is in contact with Sarah&#x27;s Mother xxx xxx - which is concerning. He denied being in a relationship with Sarah in our interview August 2022.
        
        Previous Oasys highlights concerns in relation to CSE so these will need to be monitored in the event that Mr Davies begins to target teenage girls for intimate relationships. 
        
        Mr Davies is reported to have a history of entering relationship with younger females and a previous OM was advised by HMP Cardiff of a call list whereby Mr Davies was calling females some of whom were known to CSE/Operation Quartz. Mr Davies also has an on/off relationship with Ms Sarah Smith. There are significant DV concerns within this relationship. 
        
        Whether this relationship will continue given the time he has been in custody on this occasion will remain an area to monitor.

        Mr Davies has previously been identified as a prolific offender which would indicate that he spends considerable time offending and associating with like minded individuals.  He reports no constructive activities.
        
        He has been recalled on a number of occasions whilst serving past and current sentences,  which is an indication that he is not  motivated to make changes to his lifestyle and demonstrating a lack of regard for his licence and conditions. 
        
        As previous section, there have been previous concerns regarding Child sexual exploitation therefore associates will need to be closely monitored.
        
        I have been made aware of a video circulating on social media which shows Mr Davies in a violent altercation with an associate- xxx xxx. The police were investigating this incident with a view to an Affray prosecution, however no arrests have been made to date. Mr Davies appears to be trying to &#x27;slash&#x27; Mr xxx with broken glass. he describes him as a friend and they had an argument over a misunderstanding (linked to Sexual Jealousy as he believed that friend was trying to contact his partner Ms xxx). There was a further incident disclosed a week later, whereby Mr Davies claims he attempted to hit Mt xxx once again, this time with a piece of wood. Both incident occurred when Mr Davies was intoxicated.
        
        Mr Davies has raised concerns about his safety at HMP Cardiff, avoiding movements between wings to attend work for fear of others and stipulating that he need to go to HMP Berwyn for his own safety (not HMP Parc).</td></tr>

Mr Davies dismissed any issues with drug misuse in custody, stating he is drug free. He reports cocaine and cannabis use in the community and states the people he spends his time with use drugs and he struggles to say no. This will be an area to review prior to any release, to enable Mr Davies to make plans for a successful release. 

Drug use will continue to be linked to ROR and ROSH as Mr Davies has behaved violently under the influence of substances

He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \&quot;saw red\&quot; at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. </td></tr>

He started offending at a very young age and the majority of earlier offences relate to thefts and criminal damage and violence. The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing. I would consider this to be part of a pattern of similar offending behaviour. 
    
    There are clear issues relating to managing emotions especially within relationships and managing himself whilst under the influence of alcohol. The pattern of offending indicates that Mr Davies poses a continued risk to people of a similar lifestyle and staff, particularly police officers. </td></tr>

His attitudes that condone violence raise significant concerns as he has continued to use this as a technique and response to conflict. This has been the case when sober and under the influence but appears to be significantly exacerbated when under the influence of alcohol and substances. The risk Mr Davies poses is high when under the influence of alcohol. It is my assessment that analysis of offence issues are linked to the risk of serious harm. </td></tr>

                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>R10.5: What circumstances are likely to reduce the risk</td><td>In custody - his risk to Prison Officers and other prisoners will reduce - 
When Mr Davies is on a wing where he feels safe.
When he is taking his medication and seeing the psychiatrist
When he has a good relationship with staff on the wing.
When confrontation with other prisoners (who he has a history with )  is avoided. 

Interventions will need to be focused on the following areas:
3 - Accommodation 
5 - Financial Management and Income 
6 - Relationships 
7 - Lifestyle and Associates 
8 - Drug Misuse 
9 - Alcohol Misuse 
10 - Emotional Well-Being 
11 - Thinking and Behaviour 
12 - Attitudes 



Motivational interviewing will be key in attempting to engage Mr Davis not only in his statutory supervision, but within the planned interventions.

Protective factors will be explored and developed.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.4: What circumstances are likely to increase risk</td><td>In the community
1) Employment of maladaptive thinking skills (thinking that violence is appropriate way to deal with a situation).
2) Non-compliance with medication, return to drug use, change and stressful life experiences.
3) Risk is greatest when Mr Davies is entrenched in his offending peer group
4) Risk of theft related offences are greatest when Mr Davies has no income and is in need financially. Potentially for physical assault at this time. Mr Davies is not an imminent risk of serious harm to the public but identifiable indicators are clearly present. 
5) Risk to Miss xxx should their relationship resume - ongoing d/v.  If rejected by Miss xxx, potential to cause her significant physical harm, harass her and/or attempt to harm himself.  
6) Mr Davies seeking a new partner increases risk to females 16 years and under.  
7) Homelessness
8) Continued possession of weapons.
9) Perceived feelings of hopelessness/ lack of achievable goals
10) pregnancy

In custody
The risk of harm to the prisoner and Prison staff will increase when - 
There are issues with staff and prisoners on the wing.
When he believes staff are not carrying out his requests.
When he fails to manage his own behaviour as a result of being frustrated. 
When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication.
And when he is located somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.2: What is the nature of the risk</td><td>1. Sexual harm/exploitation - underage females (Previous offending)
2. Loss of property (Financial and sentimental) &amp; Psychological harm (Previous offending relating to Burglary offences). Physical - excessive us is violence
3. Domestic abuse- this can include physical, psychological financial and sexual abuse. Physical violence- including use of weapons.
4. Self harm by cutting
5.The risk is considered to be risk of injury / death as a result of fire, In addition the risk of abusive / threatening behaviour. There is also a risk of violence with the use of a weapon.
6. The risk is considered to be risk of injury / death as a result of fire, In addition the risk of abusive / threatening behaviour. There is also a risk of violence with the use of a weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.1: Who is at risk</td><td>1. Children, specifically females age 16 and under, xxx xxx
2. Public
3. Known adults, partners- specifically xxx xx and her mother, xxx xxx. Associates- specifically xxx xxx or any person he believes to have a sexual interest in his partner.
4. Self 
5.Prison Officers
6. Prisoners in custody.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.3: When is the risk likely to be the greatest</td><td>1,2,3,4
Increased substance misuse, continued excessive alcohol use, contact with previous associates, relationship difficulties or ending, loss of accommodation, on-going lack of constructive use of time then the risk is likely to be greatest.

If rejected by Miss xxx, risk to self heightened.  If relationship resumes, risk to Ms xxx and to her family is significant. Whilst there is a current restraining order, he has previously breached this.
Any new relationship/ association with teenage females. Particularly those identified as already vulnerable and within the CSE arena.

5,
The risk is likely to be the greatest when Mr Davies is having difficulty on the wing, when he believes staff are not doing what he asks, when he can&#x27;t manange his frustrations and does not get his own way. When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication and is somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner - the risk of his harmful behaviour will be at its greatest.

6.The risk is likely to be the greatest when Mr Davies is having difficulty on the wing, and he feels threatened by other prisoners.  When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication and is located somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner - the risk of his harmful behaviour will be at its greatest. Risk is HIGH</td></tr></table><br/>
                
                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>2.4.1: Victim - perpetrator relationship</td><td>The victim was an acquaintance of Mr Davies. Mr Davies reports he knew of him but they would not be considered friends. </td></tr><tr><td>2.98: Issues contributing to risks</td><td>Mr Davies has poor emotional control and difficulties solving problems in a pro-social manner. His attitudes that condone violence raise significant concerns as he has continued to use this as a technique and response to conflict. This has been the case when sober and under the influence but appears to be significantly exacerbated when under the influence of alcohol and substances. The risk Mr Davies poses is high when under the influence of alcohol. It is my assessment that analysis of offence issues are linked to the risk of serious harm. </td></tr><tr><td>2.12: Pattern of offending</td><td>Mr Davies has accrued 24 previous convictions. He started offending at a very young age and the majority of earlier offences relate to thefts and criminal damage and violence. The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing. I would consider this to be part of a pattern of similar offending behaviour. 
    
    There are clear issues relating to managing emotions especially within relationships and managing himself whilst under the influence of alcohol. The pattern of offending indicates that Mr Davies poses a continued risk to people of a similar lifestyle and staff, particularly police officers. </td></tr><tr><td>2.4.2: Other victim information</td><td>None known. </td></tr><tr><td>2.1: Offence analysis</td><td>On 28/09/2022, Mr Davies was sentencted at xxx Magistrate&#x27;s Court for the offence of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress to 12 weeks Adult Custody inc PSS. The details of the offence are as follows:
    
    On 27/09/22 at 1220 at Old Market Square, xxx, This is a case of Section 5 threatening behaviour in xxx City Centre witnessed by Community Protection Officers. On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight. Patrolling Officers are advised by a member of public of the fight and attend and intervene. The defendant has been argumentative and refused to calm down, eventually climbing onto a wall and punching the other male to the side of the head. Although the aggreived party has not wished to pursue a complaint, the threats and act of violence has occurred in front of attending Officers wearing BWV.
    
    Roger SMITH has stated that he was in uniform on foot patrol when he has been informed of a fight on Long Row. Whilst walking up to the incident he has seen a male now known to be defendant punching another male in the head. During the incident defendant has been shouting and was agitated. 
    
    Senior CPO 4190 BLACK statement states that whilst on foot patrol she has been approached by a member of the public who has informed her of a fight. When BLACK has approached Debenhams Long Row she has seen a group of people near the flower beds and has activated her BWV E7123. BLACK has approached the defendant who was shouting and gesturing towards other people. The defendant has then approached another male and has punched him in the side of the head.</td></tr><tr><td>2.5: Impact on the victim</td><td>Physical harm due to violence used towards the victim. Psychological harm as the incident happened in the day in a public place. The wider public may also be experiencing emotional trauma had they been witness to the incident. </td></tr><tr><td>2.8.3: Motivation and triggers</td><td>Mr Davies states he does not remember much about the incident but knows he was under the influence of alcohol and amphetamine. He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \&quot;saw red\&quot; at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. </td></tr></table><br/>
                
                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>6.9: Relationship issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his relationship history therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Mr Davies reported that he has been in an &#x27;on/off relationship with Sarah Smith for a number of years. They had a daughter in 2018, xxx, who was adopted out of the family 2019. Records indicate that the cause of concern for safeguarding was Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour and Ms Smiths continued relationship with him against the recommendation of the child protection plan.
        
        There are ongoing concerns regarding domestic abuse within Mr Davies and Ms Smiths relationship. He was further convicted for an assault upon Ms Smith in November 2020 and a Restraining Order was put in place to further safeguard her from Mr Davies preventing any contact. He is aware this expires in November 2023. He is in contact with Sarah&#x27;s Mother xxx xxx - which is concerning. He denied being in a relationship with Sarah in our interview August 2022.
        
        Previous Oasys highlights concerns in relation to CSE so these will need to be monitored in the event that Mr Davies begins to target teenage girls for intimate relationships. 
        
        Mr Davies is reported to have a history of entering relationship with younger females and a previous OM was advised by HMP Cardiff of a call list whereby Mr Davies was calling females some of whom were known to CSE/Operation Quartz. Mr Davies also has an on/off relationship with Ms Sarah Smith. There are significant DV concerns within this relationship. 
        
        Whether this relationship will continue given the time he has been in custody on this occasion will remain an area to monitor. 
        
        
        Due to his previous convictions and continued behaviour this area has been linked to both harm and offending. </td></tr><tr><td>8.9: Drug misuse issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Mr Davies reports that whilst he has engaged in high levels of polydrug use, he has ceased his use of substance in favour of alcohol use. Whilst this is Mr Davies&#x27; recent disclosure, I will not yet change the scoring levels of above drug use until such a time when abstinence can be evidenced via drug testing.

Mr Davies dismissed any issues with drug misuse in custody, stating he is drug free. He reports cocaine and cannabis use in the community and states the people he spends his time with use drugs and he struggles to say no. This will be an area to review prior to any release, to enable Mr Davies to make plans for a successful release. 

Drug use will continue to be linked to ROR and ROSH as Mr Davies has behaved violently under the influence of substances

</td></tr><tr><td>7.9: Lifestyle issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his history linked to lifestyle and associates therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Mr Davies has previously been identified as a prolific offender which would indicate that he spends considerable time offending and associating with like minded individuals.  He reports no constructive activities.
        
        He has been recalled on a number of occasions whilst serving past and current sentences,  which is an indication that he is not  motivated to make changes to his lifestyle and demonstrating a lack of regard for his licence and conditions. 
        
        As previous section, there have been previous concerns regarding Child sexual exploitation therefore associates will need to be closely monitored.
        
        I have been made aware of a video circulating on social media which shows Mr Davies in a violent altercation with an associate- xxx xxx. The police were investigating this incident with a view to an Affray prosecution, however no arrests have been made to date. Mr Davies appears to be trying to &#x27;slash&#x27; Mr xxx with broken glass. he describes him as a friend and they had an argument over a misunderstanding (linked to Sexual Jealousy as he believed that friend was trying to contact his partner Ms xxx). There was a further incident disclosed a week later, whereby Mr Davies claims he attempted to hit Mt xxx once again, this time with a piece of wood. Both incident occurred when Mr Davies was intoxicated.
        
        Mr Davies has raised concerns about his safety at HMP Cardiff, avoiding movements between wings to attend work for fear of others and stipulating that he need to go to HMP Berwyn for his own safety (not HMP Parc).</td></tr><tr><td>9.9: Alcohol misuse issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Some details</td></tr><tr><td>12.9: Issues about attitudes contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Since sentenceing in NOvember 2022 Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour has been extremely poor resulting in him being moved to the segregation unit on one occasion. He has evidenced by his behaviour a pro criminal attitude both to staff and wider society in general


        He has previously presented with pro-criminal attitudes and has minimised his own behaviour and blamed others fro his actions- ie: places blame on his partner Ms Small for his own behaviour. During past and current supervision periods, Mr Davies has failed to comply with appointments and conditions, resulting in convictions for breach and recalls on licence. 
        
        There is no evidence of discriminatory attitudes. 
        
        It is clear that Mr Davies places his own perceived needs and wishes, above those of his victims, partner, community and society. Given his history of offending he has evidenced poor motivation to change and holds attitudes that are supportive of offending behaviour.
        
        I have met Mr Davies a number of times at HMP Berwyn  and he always been polite with me, and there have not been any overt attitudes of concern. I am aware his behaviour can be difficult on the wing. 
        
        Attitudes will be linked to ROR and ROSH</td></tr><tr><td>10.9: Issues of emotional well-being contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his history of self harm therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Pre-release 08/04/20 his behaviour has been turbulent in custody. . He has self harmed, there have been Code Red incidents and open ACCT’s. ACCT 10/03/20 for superficial cuts to his forearm and on 24/03/20 for superficial scratches to his left arm where he reported feeling frustrated that staff were not doing anything for him.  
        
        He does not report any suicidal intent at this time, and the last time an ACCT was open was in December 2021. There have been no incidents of this nature since his arrival at HMP Cardiff in April 2022. He is currently seeing Dr xxx and receiving medication for his ADHD - &#x27;xxxx&#x27; which he has been prescribed since 2019. 
        
        Emotional wellbeing to be linked to ROSH. No evidence of links to ROR at this time
        
        18/01/2023 - No suicidal intent evidenced since the current sentencing but xxxx has struggled in custody since this sentence as he was not expecting to recieve such a long sentence. He has struggled to manage his behaviour and been relocated to the CASU and been invloved in fighting with other prisoners.</td></tr><tr><td>3.9: Accommodation issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Currently in HMP Berwyn : Start Custody due to new sentence:

        Mr Davies said he was technically homeless prior to this sentence. was placed in temporary accommodation in the xx xxx, xxx, by xxx City Council. Historically, he has also expressed a wish to live with his ex-partner, Sarah Smith however significant safeguarding issues were identified and this was not deemed as an approved address, additionally there is a Restraining Order in place to safeguard Ms Smith to prevent any contact.
        
        Mr Davies was released from custody on 11/12/20 street homeless, all necessary referrals were completed for additional housing support however on 12/12/20 a call was made to the police from his ex partners mother claiming that he was with Ms Smith at her property, the police attended and found that he was in the property he was subsequently arrested and charged with Breach of Restraining Order, he appeared in court and received a financial penalty. Despite this given the concerns in terms of this breach a decision was made to recall Mr Davies to custody.
        
        Mr Davies was re-released on 29/01/21 on PSS, where he lived with a friend on a temporary basis whilst engaging with xxx in order to secure accommodation that would be more permanent.
         
        Accommodation will be linked to ROR and ROSH as Mr Davies appears to migrate back to reside at his partners address despite conditions being in place to prevent this.
        
        
        At HMP Cardiff he states he would welcome a period in AP, and he believes a return to Newport would put him at risk of re offending due to his associated there. </td></tr><tr><td>11.9: Thinking / behavioural issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>No Data Held</td></tr></table><br/>

        Mr Davies was released from custody on 11/12/20 street homeless, all necessary referrals were completed for additional housing support however on 12/12/20 a call was made to the police from his ex partners mother claiming that he was with Ms Smith at her property, the police attended and found that he was in the property he was subsequently arrested and charged with Breach of Restraining Order, he appeared in court and received a financial penalty. Despite this given the concerns in terms of this breach a decision was made to recall Mr Davies to custody.

Records indicate that the cause of concern for safeguarding was Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour and Ms Smiths continued relationship with him against the recommendation of the child protection plan.
        
        There are ongoing concerns regarding domestic abuse within Mr Davies and Ms Smiths relationship. He was further convicted for an assault upon Ms Smith in November 2020 and a Restraining Order was put in place to further safeguard her from Mr Davies preventing any contact. He is aware this expires in November 2023. He is in contact with Sarah&#x27;s Mother xxx xxx - which is concerning. He denied being in a relationship with Sarah in our interview August 2022.
        
        Previous Oasys highlights concerns in relation to CSE so these will need to be monitored in the event that Mr Davies begins to target teenage girls for intimate relationships. 
        
        Mr Davies is reported to have a history of entering relationship with younger females and a previous OM was advised by HMP Cardiff of a call list whereby Mr Davies was calling females some of whom were known to CSE/Operation Quartz. Mr Davies also has an on/off relationship with Ms Sarah Smith. There are significant DV concerns within this relationship.

        He has been recalled on a number of occasions whilst serving past and current sentences,  which is an indication that he is not  motivated to make changes to his lifestyle and demonstrating a lack of regard for his licence and conditions.

        I have been made aware of a video circulating on social media which shows Mr Davies in a violent altercation with an associate- xxx xxx. The police were investigating this incident with a view to an Affray prosecution, however no arrests have been made to date. Mr Davies appears to be trying to &#x27;slash&#x27; Mr xxx with broken glass. he describes him as a friend and they had an argument over a misunderstanding (linked to Sexual Jealousy as he believed that friend was trying to contact his partner Ms xxx). There was a further incident disclosed a week later, whereby Mr Davies claims he attempted to hit Mt xxx once again, this time with a piece of wood. Both incident occurred when Mr Davies was intoxicated.
        
        Mr Davies has raised concerns about his safety at HMP Cardiff, avoiding movements between wings to attend work for fear of others and stipulating that he need to go to HMP Berwyn for his own safety (not HMP Parc).</td></tr>

Mr Davies dismissed any issues with drug misuse in custody, stating he is drug free.

This will be an area to review prior to any release, to enable Mr Davies to make plans for a successful release.

He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \&quot;saw red\&quot; at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. </td></tr>

He started offending at a very young age and the majority of earlier offences relate to thefts and criminal damage and violence. The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing. I would consider this to be part of a pattern of similar offending behaviour. 
    
    There are clear issues relating to managing emotions especially within relationships and managing himself whilst under the influence of alcohol. The pattern of offending indicates that Mr Davies poses a continued risk to people of a similar lifestyle and staff, particularly police officers. </td></tr>

His attitudes that condone violence raise significant concerns as he has continued to use this as a technique and response to conflict. This has been the case when sober and under the influence but appears to be significantly exacerbated when under the influence of alcohol and substances. The risk Mr Davies poses is high when under the influence of alcohol. It is my assessment that analysis of offence issues are linked to the risk of serious harm. </td></tr>

                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>R10.5: What circumstances are likely to reduce the risk</td><td>In custody - his risk to Prison Officers and other prisoners will reduce - 
When Mr Davies is on a wing where he feels safe.
When he is taking his medication and seeing the psychiatrist
When he has a good relationship with staff on the wing.
When confrontation with other prisoners (who he has a history with )  is avoided. 

Interventions will need to be focused on the following areas:
3 - Accommodation 
5 - Financial Management and Income 
6 - Relationships 
7 - Lifestyle and Associates 
8 - Drug Misuse 
9 - Alcohol Misuse 
10 - Emotional Well-Being 
11 - Thinking and Behaviour 
12 - Attitudes 



Motivational interviewing will be key in attempting to engage Mr Davis not only in his statutory supervision, but within the planned interventions.

Protective factors will be explored and developed.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.4: What circumstances are likely to increase risk</td><td>In the community
1) Employment of maladaptive thinking skills (thinking that violence is appropriate way to deal with a situation).
2) Non-compliance with medication, return to drug use, change and stressful life experiences.
3) Risk is greatest when Mr Davies is entrenched in his offending peer group
4) Risk of theft related offences are greatest when Mr Davies has no income and is in need financially. Potentially for physical assault at this time. Mr Davies is not an imminent risk of serious harm to the public but identifiable indicators are clearly present. 
5) Risk to Miss xxx should their relationship resume - ongoing d/v.  If rejected by Miss xxx, potential to cause her significant physical harm, harass her and/or attempt to harm himself.  
6) Mr Davies seeking a new partner increases risk to females 16 years and under.  
7) Homelessness
8) Continued possession of weapons.
9) Perceived feelings of hopelessness/ lack of achievable goals
10) pregnancy

In custody
The risk of harm to the prisoner and Prison staff will increase when - 
There are issues with staff and prisoners on the wing.
When he believes staff are not carrying out his requests.
When he fails to manage his own behaviour as a result of being frustrated. 
When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication.
And when he is located somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.2: What is the nature of the risk</td><td>1. Sexual harm/exploitation - underage females (Previous offending)
2. Loss of property (Financial and sentimental) &amp; Psychological harm (Previous offending relating to Burglary offences). Physical - excessive us is violence
3. Domestic abuse- this can include physical, psychological financial and sexual abuse. Physical violence- including use of weapons.
4. Self harm by cutting
5.The risk is considered to be risk of injury / death as a result of fire, In addition the risk of abusive / threatening behaviour. There is also a risk of violence with the use of a weapon.
6. The risk is considered to be risk of injury / death as a result of fire, In addition the risk of abusive / threatening behaviour. There is also a risk of violence with the use of a weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.1: Who is at risk</td><td>1. Children, specifically females age 16 and under, xxx xxx
2. Public
3. Known adults, partners- specifically xxx xx and her mother, xxx xxx. Associates- specifically xxx xxx or any person he believes to have a sexual interest in his partner.
4. Self 
5.Prison Officers
6. Prisoners in custody.</td></tr><tr><td>R10.3: When is the risk likely to be the greatest</td><td>1,2,3,4
Increased substance misuse, continued excessive alcohol use, contact with previous associates, relationship difficulties or ending, loss of accommodation, on-going lack of constructive use of time then the risk is likely to be greatest.

If rejected by Miss xxx, risk to self heightened.  If relationship resumes, risk to Ms xxx and to her family is significant. Whilst there is a current restraining order, he has previously breached this.
Any new relationship/ association with teenage females. Particularly those identified as already vulnerable and within the CSE arena.

5,
The risk is likely to be the greatest when Mr Davies is having difficulty on the wing, when he believes staff are not doing what he asks, when he can&#x27;t manange his frustrations and does not get his own way. When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication and is somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner - the risk of his harmful behaviour will be at its greatest.

6.The risk is likely to be the greatest when Mr Davies is having difficulty on the wing, and he feels threatened by other prisoners.  When Mr Davies is not taking his ADHD medication and is located somewhere where he believes he is at risk from other prisoner - the risk of his harmful behaviour will be at its greatest. Risk is HIGH</td></tr></table><br/>
                
                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>2.4.1: Victim - perpetrator relationship</td><td>The victim was an acquaintance of Mr Davies. Mr Davies reports he knew of him but they would not be considered friends. </td></tr><tr><td>2.98: Issues contributing to risks</td><td>Mr Davies has poor emotional control and difficulties solving problems in a pro-social manner. His attitudes that condone violence raise significant concerns as he has continued to use this as a technique and response to conflict. This has been the case when sober and under the influence but appears to be significantly exacerbated when under the influence of alcohol and substances. The risk Mr Davies poses is high when under the influence of alcohol. It is my assessment that analysis of offence issues are linked to the risk of serious harm. </td></tr><tr><td>2.12: Pattern of offending</td><td>Mr Davies has accrued 24 previous convictions. He started offending at a very young age and the majority of earlier offences relate to thefts and criminal damage and violence. The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing. I would consider this to be part of a pattern of similar offending behaviour. 
    
    There are clear issues relating to managing emotions especially within relationships and managing himself whilst under the influence of alcohol. The pattern of offending indicates that Mr Davies poses a continued risk to people of a similar lifestyle and staff, particularly police officers. </td></tr><tr><td>2.4.2: Other victim information</td><td>None known. </td></tr><tr><td>2.1: Offence analysis</td><td>On 28/09/2022, Mr Davies was sentencted at xxx Magistrate&#x27;s Court for the offence of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress to 12 weeks Adult Custody inc PSS. The details of the offence are as follows:
    
    On 27/09/22 at 1220 at Old Market Square, xxx, This is a case of Section 5 threatening behaviour in xxx City Centre witnessed by Community Protection Officers. On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight. Patrolling Officers are advised by a member of public of the fight and attend and intervene. The defendant has been argumentative and refused to calm down, eventually climbing onto a wall and punching the other male to the side of the head. Although the aggreived party has not wished to pursue a complaint, the threats and act of violence has occurred in front of attending Officers wearing BWV.
    
    Roger SMITH has stated that he was in uniform on foot patrol when he has been informed of a fight on Long Row. Whilst walking up to the incident he has seen a male now known to be defendant punching another male in the head. During the incident defendant has been shouting and was agitated. 
    
    Senior CPO 4190 BLACK statement states that whilst on foot patrol she has been approached by a member of the public who has informed her of a fight. When BLACK has approached Debenhams Long Row she has seen a group of people near the flower beds and has activated her BWV E7123. BLACK has approached the defendant who was shouting and gesturing towards other people. The defendant has then approached another male and has punched him in the side of the head.</td></tr><tr><td>2.5: Impact on the victim</td><td>Physical harm due to violence used towards the victim. Psychological harm as the incident happened in the day in a public place. The wider public may also be experiencing emotional trauma had they been witness to the incident. </td></tr><tr><td>2.8.3: Motivation and triggers</td><td>Mr Davies states he does not remember much about the incident but knows he was under the influence of alcohol and amphetamine. He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \&quot;saw red\&quot; at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. </td></tr></table><br/>
                
                    <table class="summary-list"><tr><td>6.9: Relationship issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his relationship history therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Mr Davies reported that he has been in an &#x27;on/off relationship with Sarah Smith for a number of years. They had a daughter in 2018, xxx, who was adopted out of the family 2019. Records indicate that the cause of concern for safeguarding was Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour and Ms Smiths continued relationship with him against the recommendation of the child protection plan.
        
        There are ongoing concerns regarding domestic abuse within Mr Davies and Ms Smiths relationship. He was further convicted for an assault upon Ms Smith in November 2020 and a Restraining Order was put in place to further safeguard her from Mr Davies preventing any contact. He is aware this expires in November 2023. He is in contact with Sarah&#x27;s Mother xxx xxx - which is concerning. He denied being in a relationship with Sarah in our interview August 2022.
        
        Previous Oasys highlights concerns in relation to CSE so these will need to be monitored in the event that Mr Davies begins to target teenage girls for intimate relationships. 
        
        Mr Davies is reported to have a history of entering relationship with younger females and a previous OM was advised by HMP Cardiff of a call list whereby Mr Davies was calling females some of whom were known to CSE/Operation Quartz. Mr Davies also has an on/off relationship with Ms Sarah Smith. There are significant DV concerns within this relationship. 
        
        Whether this relationship will continue given the time he has been in custody on this occasion will remain an area to monitor. 
        
        
        Due to his previous convictions and continued behaviour this area has been linked to both harm and offending. </td></tr><tr><td>8.9: Drug misuse issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Mr Davies reports that whilst he has engaged in high levels of polydrug use, he has ceased his use of substance in favour of alcohol use. Whilst this is Mr Davies&#x27; recent disclosure, I will not yet change the scoring levels of above drug use until such a time when abstinence can be evidenced via drug testing.

Mr Davies dismissed any issues with drug misuse in custody, stating he is drug free. He reports cocaine and cannabis use in the community and states the people he spends his time with use drugs and he struggles to say no. This will be an area to review prior to any release, to enable Mr Davies to make plans for a successful release. 

Drug use will continue to be linked to ROR and ROSH as Mr Davies has behaved violently under the influence of substances

</td></tr><tr><td>7.9: Lifestyle issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his history linked to lifestyle and associates therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Mr Davies has previously been identified as a prolific offender which would indicate that he spends considerable time offending and associating with like minded individuals.  He reports no constructive activities.
        
        He has been recalled on a number of occasions whilst serving past and current sentences,  which is an indication that he is not  motivated to make changes to his lifestyle and demonstrating a lack of regard for his licence and conditions. 
        
        As previous section, there have been previous concerns regarding Child sexual exploitation therefore associates will need to be closely monitored.
        
        I have been made aware of a video circulating on social media which shows Mr Davies in a violent altercation with an associate- xxx xxx. The police were investigating this incident with a view to an Affray prosecution, however no arrests have been made to date. Mr Davies appears to be trying to &#x27;slash&#x27; Mr xxx with broken glass. he describes him as a friend and they had an argument over a misunderstanding (linked to Sexual Jealousy as he believed that friend was trying to contact his partner Ms xxx). There was a further incident disclosed a week later, whereby Mr Davies claims he attempted to hit Mt xxx once again, this time with a piece of wood. Both incident occurred when Mr Davies was intoxicated.
        
        Mr Davies has raised concerns about his safety at HMP Cardiff, avoiding movements between wings to attend work for fear of others and stipulating that he need to go to HMP Berwyn for his own safety (not HMP Parc).</td></tr><tr><td>9.9: Alcohol misuse issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Some details</td></tr><tr><td>12.9: Issues about attitudes contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Since sentenceing in NOvember 2022 Mr Davies&#x27; behaviour has been extremely poor resulting in him being moved to the segregation unit on one occasion. He has evidenced by his behaviour a pro criminal attitude both to staff and wider society in general


        He has previously presented with pro-criminal attitudes and has minimised his own behaviour and blamed others fro his actions- ie: places blame on his partner Ms Small for his own behaviour. During past and current supervision periods, Mr Davies has failed to comply with appointments and conditions, resulting in convictions for breach and recalls on licence. 
        
        There is no evidence of discriminatory attitudes. 
        
        It is clear that Mr Davies places his own perceived needs and wishes, above those of his victims, partner, community and society. Given his history of offending he has evidenced poor motivation to change and holds attitudes that are supportive of offending behaviour.
        
        I have met Mr Davies a number of times at HMP Berwyn  and he always been polite with me, and there have not been any overt attitudes of concern. I am aware his behaviour can be difficult on the wing. 
        
        Attitudes will be linked to ROR and ROSH</td></tr><tr><td>10.9: Issues of emotional well-being contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Previous Oasys records outline his history of self harm therefore I will outline the current circumstances.

        Pre-release 08/04/20 his behaviour has been turbulent in custody. . He has self harmed, there have been Code Red incidents and open ACCT’s. ACCT 10/03/20 for superficial cuts to his forearm and on 24/03/20 for superficial scratches to his left arm where he reported feeling frustrated that staff were not doing anything for him.  
        
        He does not report any suicidal intent at this time, and the last time an ACCT was open was in December 2021. There have been no incidents of this nature since his arrival at HMP Cardiff in April 2022. He is currently seeing Dr xxx and receiving medication for his ADHD - &#x27;xxxx&#x27; which he has been prescribed since 2019. 
        
        Emotional wellbeing to be linked to ROSH. No evidence of links to ROR at this time
        
        18/01/2023 - No suicidal intent evidenced since the current sentencing but xxxx has struggled in custody since this sentence as he was not expecting to recieve such a long sentence. He has struggled to manage his behaviour and been relocated to the CASU and been invloved in fighting with other prisoners.</td></tr><tr><td>3.9: Accommodation issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>Currently in HMP Berwyn : Start Custody due to new sentence:

        Mr Davies said he was technically homeless prior to this sentence. was placed in temporary accommodation in the xx xxx, xxx, by xxx City Council. Historically, he has also expressed a wish to live with his ex-partner, Sarah Smith however significant safeguarding issues were identified and this was not deemed as an approved address, additionally there is a Restraining Order in place to safeguard Ms Smith to prevent any contact.
        
        Mr Davies was released from custody on 11/12/20 street homeless, all necessary referrals were completed for additional housing support however on 12/12/20 a call was made to the police from his ex partners mother claiming that he was with Ms Smith at her property, the police attended and found that he was in the property he was subsequently arrested and charged with Breach of Restraining Order, he appeared in court and received a financial penalty. Despite this given the concerns in terms of this breach a decision was made to recall Mr Davies to custody.
        
        Mr Davies was re-released on 29/01/21 on PSS, where he lived with a friend on a temporary basis whilst engaging with xxx in order to secure accommodation that would be more permanent.
         
        Accommodation will be linked to ROR and ROSH as Mr Davies appears to migrate back to reside at his partners address despite conditions being in place to prevent this.
        
        
        At HMP Cardiff he states he would welcome a period in AP, and he believes a return to Newport would put him at risk of re offending due to his associated there. </td></tr><tr><td>11.9: Thinking / behavioural issues contributing to risks of offending and harm</td><td>No Data Held</td></tr></table><br/>
